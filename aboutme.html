    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In my personal life, I am working toward being a better person for others in this world. I am working towards these goals by being kind and respectful to my family, friends, and acquittances. It doesn't take much to give a compliment to make someone's day. The values that I most consider for my success is hardworking, honesty, and leadership. I believe that you always have to put in the work to receive anything back. Leadership is most important because you can be that guidance for others, create ideas, and problem solve to conflicts. Short term goals that I hope I can accomplish in the near future is getting all A's and passing my finals. I currently getting all A's and one B each quarter. Working a bit harder and studying for my classes will help me achieve that. Character traits I want to be known for is being selfless, thoughtful, and caring. It is hard finding people who put themselves last and that are true to their friendships. Achievements I want to be known for is being on top in my classes and graduating from college. I want to be able to graduate from FGCU with a psychology degree.</p>
